# API Web-Scraping NBA Stats in Python
# Introduction
In the first part of the project(main.ipynb), I scrape data from nba.com/stats for analysis, found NBA APIs, and scrape data on a large scale with the Python requests package. In the second part of the project(analysis.ipynb), I used the data that I scraped so that I can ultimately visualize three main topics regarding NBA stats:

1) Player stat correlations
2) Player minutes and scoring distributions (Playoffs vs. Regular Season)
3) How the game has changed over the past decade (Playoffs vs. Regular Season)
